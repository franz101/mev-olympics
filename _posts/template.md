The champion of this disclipline will be awarded with the NFT for having the most leading zeores in the address.

The smart contract for the allowlist features the following function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function getLeadingZeroes(address addr) public view returns (uint) {
        bytes20 bytesAdr = bytes20(addr);
        uint counter = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            if (uint8(bytesAdr[i]) == 0) {
                counter++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
{% endhighlight %}
